          <h3>What is Psoriasis</h3>
          <p>
          Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune disease that appears on the skin. It occurs when the immune system sends out faulty signals that speed up the growth cycle of skin cells. Psoriasis is not contagious.  
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>What does this mean for me</h4>
          <p>
          This means that psoriasis is going to be with you for a while. Now depending on the type of psoriasis that you have there are different treatments and therapies. Don't worry though, even if you're stuck with psoriasis it won't affect you socially unless you let it.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>What are the different types of Psoriasis</h4>
          <p>
          According to the <a href="http://www.psoriasis.org">National Psoriasis Foundation</a> there are 5 types of psoriasis.

                  Plaque psoriasis is the most common of all the types. About 80% of those with psoriasis have this type. You can recognize it by raised, inflamed, red lesions covered by a silvery white scale. It is typically found on the elbows, knees, scalp and lower back.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="type-guttate">
                <p>
                  Guttate psoriasis is form that often starts in childhood or young adulthood. It appears at small, red, individual spots usually located on the trunk and limbs and are not as thick as plaque lesions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Guttate psoriasis often comes on quite suddenly. A variety of conditions can bring on an attack of guttate psoriasis, including upper respiratory infections, strep throat, tonsillitis, stress, injury to the skin and the administration of certain drugs including antimalarials and beta-blockers.

                <p>
                  Inverse psoriasis is found in the armpits, groin, under the breasts, and in other skin folds. It appears as bright red, smooth, and shiny lesions. Inverse psoriasis is subject to irritation from rubbing and sweating because of its location in skin folds and tender areas. It can be more troublesome in overweight people and those with deep skin folds.
                </p>

              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="type-pustular">
                <p>
                  Mostly seen in adults, pustular psoriasis is characterized by blisters consisting of white blood cells. There 3 <a href="http://www.psoriasis.org/about-psoriasis/types/pustular">types</a> of pustular psoriasis though none are infectious.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pustular psoriasis may be triggered by internal medications, irritating topical agents, overexposure to UV light, pregnancy, systemic steroids, infections, stress and sudden withdrawal of systemic medications or potent topical steroids.

                <p>
                  Erythrodermic psoriasis is a particularly inflammatory form of psoriasis that affects most of the body surface.  It is characterized by periodic, widespread, fiery redness of the skin and the shedding of scales in sheets, rather than smaller flakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People experiencing the symptoms of erythrodermic psoriasis flare should go see a doctor immediately. Erythrodermic psoriasis causes protein and fluid loss that can lead to severe illness. The condition may also bring on infection, pneumonia and congestive heart failure. People with severe cases of this condition often require hospitalization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Known triggers of erythrodermic psoriasis include the abrupt withdrawal of a systemic psoriasis treatment including cortisone; allergic reaction to a drug resulting in the Koebner response; severe sunburns; infection; and medications such as lithium, anti-malarial drugs; and strong coal tar products.

            <div class="treatment">
              <p>
                Topical treatments are medications applied to the skin and are usually the first form of treatment prescribed. Topicals sow down excessive cell reproduction and reduce inflammation associated with psoriasis. Many topicals can be purchased over the counters while others can be prescribed by your dermatologist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Corticosteroids are the most frequently used treatment because of their ability to reduce the swelling and redness of lesions. Salicylic acid and coal tar are 2 active ingredients approved by the FDA and, along with other ingredients like aloe vera and jojoba, are used to moisturize, remove scales, and relieve itching and redness.

            <div class="treatment">
              <p>
                Phototherapy or light therapy, involves exposing the skin to ultraviolet light on a regular basis and under medical supervision. Treatments are done in a doctor's office or psoriasis clinic or at home with phototherapy unit. The key to success with light therapy is consistency.

            <div class="treatment">
              <p>
                Systemic medications are prescription drugs that work throughout the body. They are usually used for individuals with moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Systemic medications are also used in those who are not responsive or are unable to take topical medications or UV light therapy. Systemics fall into 2 categories: traditional systemics and biologics. Some traditional systemics include:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="http://www.psoriasis.org/about-psoriasis/treatments/systemics/soriatane">Acitretin (Soriatane)</a></li>

                </ul>
              </p> 
              <p>
                Biologics are relatively new and are given by injection or intravenous infusion (IV). Unlike traditional systemic drugs, biologics impact the entire immune system and come with side effects and risks. Common side effects include: respiratory infections, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions but these effects are usually mild and do not cause most to stop taking the medication.All biologics can be used along side other treatments such as phototherapy and topicals. Biologics on the market include:

              <p>
                Some people today with chronic conditions show an interest in complementary and alternative therapies which focus more on preventative care and pain management. These therapies include diet, herbs and supplements, mind/body therapies such as aromatherapy, yoga and meditation, physical therapies, exercise and the ancient arts of acupuncture and tai chi. Always talk to your doctor or consult with a licensed health care professional before adding any complementary and alternative treatments to your treatment plan for psoriasis.
